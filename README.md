Location Tracker Project
This project demonstrates a real-time location tracking system using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js. The application allows multiple users to share their location in real time, visualize it on a map, and track when users connect or disconnect.

Features:
Real-time Location Tracking: Users' geographic positions are updated in real-time on the map as they move.
Map Display: A dynamic map (powered by Leaflet.js) shows users' positions as markers.
Multiple Users Support: Multiple users can share their location simultaneously, and all participants will see the movement of others in real time.
User Disconnect Tracking: When a user disconnects, their location marker is removed from the map.
